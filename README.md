# Hidden-Markov-Model

 (20 pts) Given the fully observable Markov model with four states, S1, S2, S3, S4, transition probabilities
A =
0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3
0.1 0.3 0.2 0.4
0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4
0.1 0.1 0.1 0.7

and initial probabilities
Π = [0.5,0.1,0.3,0.1]

--Generate 200 sequences of 500 states.
--Using the data generated in part (a), re-estimate Π, A and compare with the parameters used to
generate the data.
--Repeat part (b) using hmmlearn package. You can select a suitable emission probability distribution from available options in hmmlearn. Report and comment on
--X the parameter/model/distribution selection from hmmlearn package 
--X the differences in the computed values from part
